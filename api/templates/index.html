                                            SpotVac was developed because many people on spotify have "liked music" playlists that number in the thousands, but no time or will to sort every song into its respective playlist.
                                            Spotvac collects all of your liked music, plus any music from public playlists that you follow, and sorts them based on data from Spotify's API.
                                            Spotvac is designed to be as simple as possible to use, with just one click your playlists will be sorted based on Thayer's human emotional classification model.

                                        <p class="about">
                                            In a world in internet privacy and data breaches, Spotvac was developed with the explicit intention of not collecting user information.
                                            Unfortunately, in order to cooperate with the Spotify API, SpotVac collects a few minor pieces of information.
                                            The information collected is the Spotify username and unique user id, which are publicly available.

                                            For privacy reasons, SpotVac is designed to only have access to your public playlists.
                                            If you would like SpotVac to organize songs from playlists other than your liked songs, make sure they are public before clicking the sort button.
                                            Most playlists are public by default.
                                            You can private playlists by going to your profile, right-clicking on the playlist, and clicking "Remove from Profile".
                                            This will not delete the playlist, it will only remove the playlist from your public profile. 
                                            (You can public or private them back after the playlists are made)

                                            Clicking the sort button will take you to a maximum of two screens. 
                                            The first one will require you to log into your Spotify account, this is an official Spotify log in.
                                            If this does not appear, it means you are already logged in.
                                            After logging into your account, you will have to authorize SpotVacs access to your account. 
                                            You will be redirected to a different official spotify page.
                                            This access is based on the "modify public playlists" scope, meaning SpotVac can

                                            In its current iteration, SpotVac goes through the publily available playlists on your profile and collects the unique ids of every song.
                                            Then SpotVac uses the Spotify API to collect detailed song information about each song.
                                            Depending on how many playlists and songs were available to SpotVac, the collection may take a couple of minutes.
                                            This process is limited by the amount of song information that SpotVac is allowed to request at a time.
                                            For more information on the Spotify API see the documentation in the footer.

                                        <p class="about2">
                                            Spotify provides a lot of information about a song, but genre is not one of them.
                                            Although SpotVac is not able to sort music into their respective genres (yet) it is often beneficial to not just sort along these lines.
                                            Most often, good playlists have multiple genres of music that express the same mood.
                                            For example: the 10th most followed playlist on Spotify is Beast Mode which has a mix of Rap, Pop, and EDM music.
                                            Although it has all these different genres of music, it does not include sad or tired music (and each of those genres have songs like that) because then you won't hit your new max.
                                        </p><br>
                                        <p class="about2">
                                            Thayer's classification of music (shown below) can be described in a couple different ways, but the way SpotVac interprets the music is this.
                                            There are two main values that SpotVac looks at: valence and energy.
                                            Valence is a way of describing how happy a song sounds, and SpotVac uses its value to determine how far left or right the song will end up on the chart.
                                            A song with low valence expresses more negative emotions than positive ones (that is not to say that negative music is bad) and will be placed further to the left.
                                            Energy is more self explanatory, its just how much energy the listener feels during the song.
                                            This is not in reference to emotional responses felt during the song (like if you felt chills or tears).
                                            Low energy songs are put closer to the bottom of the chart and higher energy songs are put closer to the top.

                                        <p class="about2">
                                            SpotVac currently sorts music into five categories: Happy, Angry, Sad, Peaceful, and Calm.
                                            It does this because music tastes and playlist lengths vary greatly and this is the best way to ensure each palylists gets a good amount of songs.
                                            In the future, SpotVac will be upgraded to do this more dynamically, and allow the user to make more decisions about what it does.
                                            The goal is to make a couple strong playlists that can be esaily fine tuned, rather than spending a lot of time making everything perfect off the bat.
                                        </p><br>
                                        <p class="about2">
                                            While SpotVac creates these playlits and adds the songs to them, they will be on your public profile with the name "SpotVac: Happy" depending on the playlist.
                                            It is important during this process to not make the playlists private as SpotVac does not have access to private playlists and songs may not get added if this happens.
                                            If you do make them private, songs will be lost and the process will have to be restarted from the beginning.
                                            The process should not take longer than 10 minutes, unless you have a rediculous amout of songs.
                                        </p>

                                            If everything worked properly, then you should have five new playlists that are nicely sorted.
                                            If everything did not work properly, then send me a message on either twitter or instagram, or open an issue on the github repository.
                                            At this point, I would like to thank you for trusting your music selection with SpotVac.
                                            SpotVac was a fun project I (slowly) made for my friends becuase I wanted to both practice my coding in a meaningful way.
                                            The whole project took about two summers, and its my first self-made project.
                                        </p>
